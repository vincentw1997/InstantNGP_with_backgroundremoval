# InstantNGP_with_backgroundremoval
The Implementation of InstantNGP (Instant Neural Graphics Primitives) with Background Removal pipeline for generating novel views of plastic containers. This implementation is based on the research done by NVIDIA on NeRF (Neural Radiance Field). 

# Special Thanks to
